# Overview

This script loads a pygame console to play a beta version of Snake. This game is supposed to contain a small green pixel that the character moves around the screen that collects red pixels that spawn randomly on the screen. As the player eats the pixels the snake grows.

This is a python file that runs a simple version of the game Snake.

Using visual studio code I wrote my python code for the game.
